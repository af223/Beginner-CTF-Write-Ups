**skill:** Inspect Element/HTML

You can navigate between directories and files by adding or removing /{directory or file name} from the URL.

Looking at the HTML, we see the line:

`<input type="hidden" name="file" value="password.php">`

This indicates a hidden file named 'password.php'. Adding '/password.php' to the end of the URL takes you to a page with the password: 7559085a.
