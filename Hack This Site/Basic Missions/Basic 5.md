# Basic 5

**skill:** HTML

---

You can use the same approach as in Basic 4. The "Send password to Sam" button is coded:

`<input type="hidden" name="to" value="sam@hackthissite.org">`

Clicking this button sends a email to the address value is set to, presumably with the password. Change the value to your email and click the button. You'll receive a email with the password: '33369400'
