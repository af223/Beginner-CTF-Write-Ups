# Basic 6

**skill:** Basic Cryptography

Enter a few strings to encrypt and see if you notice any patterns.

---

First, see what happens when you encrypt the encrypted password: d6hi<8?l --> d7jl@=Es
A pattern appears: we shift the character forward along the ASCII table by a number of {index} moves. Remember, index starts at 0, so 'd' shifts 0, '6' shifts 1, 'h' shifts 2, etc. 

The password is: d5ff839e
