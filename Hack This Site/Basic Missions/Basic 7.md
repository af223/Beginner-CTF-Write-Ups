**skill:** UNIX command (AKA know how to use Terminal)

The UNIX cal command takes a year as input and returns a calendar for that year. When there is no input, it returns a calendar of the current month. You can call multiple UNIX commands in the same line by separating them with a ';'

---

In the box, enter:

`; ls`

This gives us a calendar followed by a list of files in the current directory. There is an "obscurely named file" k1kh31b1n55h.php. Adding '/k1kh31b1n55h.php' to the end of the URL takes you to a page with the password: da37f667
