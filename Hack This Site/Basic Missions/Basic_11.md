# Basic 11

**skill:** Apache

Specifically, for this level, .htaccess.

.htaccess files are used to configure Apache. '.htaccess' is the file name, not an extension.

Refreshing the page gives the same message: "I love my music! {Song name} is the best!"

All of the songs are Elton John songs. Though there isn't a directory called /elton, there is a directory /e which contains directory /l and so forth. Once you're in the directory /n, you'll see there's no more folders to go forward on. Now, look at the .htaccess file (/basic/11/e/l/t/o/n/.htaccess). One of the files is listed as DaAnswer.

Navigating to /e/l/t/o/n/DaAnswer, you're met with the phrase "The answer is around! Just look a little harder." The password is: around.

Recall that in previous levels, the password was submitted through index.php. Go to /basic/11/index.php to submit the password.
