The HTML code for each drop down bar is 
`<option value="1">1</option>`
depending on the selected option when the vote button is clicked. The number in quotes is the value used to calculate the new weighting.

Change the code to 
`<option value="100000">1</option>`
for Raging Inferno's drop down menu to add a rating of 100000, boosting Raging Inferno's ranking to number one.
