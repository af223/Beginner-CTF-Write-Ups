# Peace Poetry: HACKED

**goal:**
 - recover the old website
 
 **skill:** HTML
 
 ---
 
 Looking at the HTML, we see a comment tacked on at the end:
 
 `Note to the webmasterThis website has been hacked, but not totally destroyed. The old website is still up. I simply copied the old index.html file to oldindex.html and remade this one. Sorry about the inconvenience.`
 
 Navigate to the oldindex.html page through the URL (go to hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/oldindex.html) to see the original page. Testing out a few submissions with the Submit Poetry link, you'll see that the site takes the user input directly without cleaning. 

In the field for 'Name of poem,' write the name of the home page `../index.html`. In the poem field, copy over the HTML code of the oldindex.html page and add the poem.
